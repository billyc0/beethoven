	    Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) is considered one of the most influencial classical musicals of 
		all time. He was originally taught how to play music by his father, also a musician. Beethoven later
		received lesson from musician Gottleb Neefe who predicted his student to be the "Next Mozart." 
		At age 12, Beethoven published his first work of music called <em>9 Variations in C Minor for piano</em>. 
	    Beethoven was later noticed by Prince Maximillian Franz who invited him to study music in Vienna. 
		One of the first concert he composed was "Opus 1, the Trios for Piano." He later wrote and composed 
		many other concerts that are still well-known to this day.
